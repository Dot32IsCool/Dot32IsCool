# I have changed my username

This account was the old username for [@Dot32Dev](https://github.com/Dot32Dev)

When changing your account's username:
> Web links to your existing repositories will continue to work. This can take a few minutes to complete after you make the change.

> If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working.

I createed this account myself so that I would be the one in control, and so that nobody could maliciously create my repositories pretending to be me. If I do not create repositories on this account previous links to my repos remain correct.

If you got here by clicking on a link to my github profile, you probably meant to go to my main account, [@Dot32Dev](https://github.com/Dot32Dev).

I made this change as I feel I have outgrown my previous username, Dot32IsCool, and that it was a childish username. Dot32Dev reflects me now and better matches my website, [dot32.dev](https://dot32.dev).
