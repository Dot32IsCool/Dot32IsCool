# I have changed my username

This account was the old username for [@Dot32Dev](https://github.com/Dot32Dev)

When renaming accounts, links to the prevous account-name's repos will redirect to the new one, unless sombody creates a new account in the old accounts username and creates repos with the same names. I created this account myself as Dot32, such that I can be the one in control. 

If you got here by clicking on a link to my github profile, you probably meant to go to my main account, [@Dot32Dev](https://github.com/Dot32Dev).

I made this change as I feel I have outgrown my previous username, Dot32IsCool, and that it was a childish username. Dot32Dev reflects me now and better matches my website, [dot32.dev](https://dot32.dev).
